# Plotly-Deploy
## Overview of the project
The project includes creating a dashboard that displays information about bacteria in the human belly button from hundreds of samples. As you can see, the dashboard allows visualization of each personâ€™s demographic information, the top 10 bacteria found, how often they clean their belly buttons, and the bacterial culture of each sample.
### Results
In this project, I used Javascript's Plotly library to create three basic graphs: horizontal bar graph, gauge graph, and bubble graph. I use D3.json to get external data and Javascript functional programming to manipulate data. I added event handlers to add interactivity to this data visualization. Once the user selects the sample ID number from the drop-down menu options, the chart will be constructed. Finally, I deployed this interactive chart through GitHub Pages.
